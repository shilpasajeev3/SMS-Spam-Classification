# SMS Spam Classification using NLP and Machine Learning
## Overview
This project focuses on the intricate task of SMS spam classification, employing a multifaceted approach that includes data exploration, cleaning, natural language processing (NLP), feature engineering, tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, vectorization, label encoding, and model building using various machine learning classifiers ('MultinomialNB', 'RandomForestClassifier', 'KNeighborsClassifier', and 'SVC'). The project culminates in a thorough evaluation using accuracy scores, cross-validation, classification reports, and confusion matrices to determine the most effective model for SMS spam detection.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle, a renowned platform for datasets and data science competitions. It provides a collection of SMS messages along with corresponding labels, distinguishing between spam and Ham messages. The dataset forms a crucial component of the project, serving as the foundation for model training and evaluation.
